Here is some feedback in order to run rogue on an HP9000 system. You
need to add the following compiler options. I modified the makefile as
follows:

HPUXFLAGS = -D_INCLUDE_HPUX_SOURCE \
	    -D_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE \
	    -D_INCLUDE_AES_SOURCE

I must add one additional comment: HP-UX does not use an /etc/termcaps
file, but a compiled file in /usr/lib/terminfo. Therefore, I may play
around with trying to compile without the -DCURSES option. Otherwise,
I'm not certain how my terminal will respond when playing the game.

Hope this feedback helps.
